# HTML Form + JS validation
## GLearning Objectives
    At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

 ## General
    What client-side validation is
    How to implement basic form validation using JavaScript.
    How to handle form submissions and perform data validation using JavaScript.

# ALL TASK

## Task 0
###  Form Validation - Password Strength
Below is the content of password.html:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <form id="passwordForm">
    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    <p id="error" style="color: red;"></p>
    </form>
    </body>
    </html>
    - Implement JavaScript validation to check the password strength when the form is submitted.
    - Retrieve the value entered in the password input field using JavaScript.
    - Your JavaScript should be written in a separate file and used as an external script in the HTML code

    - Write a function called validatePassword to validate the password based on the provided criteria.

    - The validatePassword function should check the following criteria:

    - The password must be at least 8 characters long.

    - The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.

    - The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.

    - The password must contain at least one numeric digit.

    - The password must contain at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*).

    - If the password meets all the criteria, allow the form submission.

    - If the password does not meet the criteria, display an appropriate error message in the <p> element with the id “error” .ntent when the HTML file is opened in a browser.

## Task 1
###  Form Validation - Email Validation
   Below is the content of email.html:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <form id="emailForm">
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="text" id="email" name="email">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    <p id="error" style="color: red;"></p>
    </form>
    </body>
    </html>

    - Implement JavaScript validation to check the email format when the form is submitted.

    - Retrieve the value entered in the email input field using JavaScript.

    - Your JavaScript should be written in a separate file and used as an external script in the HTML code

    - Write a function called validateEmail to validate the email based on the email format.

    - The validateEmail function should check if the email follows the standard email format, which typically includes an alphanumeric username, followed by the @ symbol, and then the domain name.

    - If the email format is correct, allow the form submission.
 
    - If the email format is incorrect, display the error message “Please enter a valid email address.” in the

    - element with the id "error".

    - Prevent the default form submission behavior using JavaScript to prevent the form from submitting if the email format is not valid.

## Task 2
###  Dynamic Form Field
Below is the content of dynamic-form.html:

    <form id="dynamicForm">
    <label for="numFields">Number of Fields:</label>
    <select id="numFields" name="numFields">
        <option value="1">1</option>
        <option value="2">2</option>
        <option value="3">3</option>
    </select>
    <div id="inputContainer"></div>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    - Implement JavaScript to generate a dynamic number of text input fields based on the selected value in the dropdown menu.

    - Retrieve the selected value from the dropdown menu using JavaScript.

    - Write a function called generateInputFields to generate the specified number of text input fields dynamically within the “inputContainer” div.

    - The generateInputFields function should take the selected value from the dropdown menu as a parameter.

    - Inside the generateInputFields function, use a loop or other appropriate logic to create the desired number of text input fields.

    - Each text input field should have a unique name attribute, such as “field1”, “field2”, etc., to differentiate them.

    - Append the dynamically generated text input fields to the “inputContainer” div.

    - Implement JavaScript validation to ensure that all dynamically generated fields are filled before submitting the form.

    - Write a function called validateForm to validate the form before submission.

    - The validateForm function should be called when the form is submitted.

    - Inside the validateForm function, retrieve the values entered in the dynamically generated text input fields using JavaScript.

    - Check if any of the fields are empty. If any field is empty, prevent the form submission and display the error message “Please fill in all fields”.

Note: You may need to use event listeners or other appropriate techniques to detect changes in the dropdown menu selection and handle form submission.

## Task 3
###   Creating, Appending, and Removing Elements
Write a JavaScript program that demonstrates the creation, appending, and removal of elements using the DOM.

Use the HTML code below as the starting point and add your JavaScript code as an internal <script> tag:

    - Write JavaScript code to select the container element using its id and store it in a variable.
    - Use the DOM API to create a new <p> element, and add New paragraph as its content
    - Append the newly created elements to the container element.
    - Add a button that removes/hides the newly created paragraph when first click and shows it when clicked again
    - Verify that the program successfully creates, appends, and toggles elements when the HTML file is opened in a browser.
